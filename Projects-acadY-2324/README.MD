# General Adivice for those taking Ades and DENG
## And mb some other stuff:
In the first few weeks the workload is pretty low and most of the assignments are getting rolled out. 

### CPF

In a few weeks you are going to have to write up a resume for CFP. Since you are prob likely to go for a coding related job, I highly suggest that you make a website portfolio( For either the interview or the resume) which was what my teacher suggested. 

### ADES

For ades, few of the most annoying things are:
1. when you are pushing and fetching from github
2. when another persons code interferes with your own - having a team that works and communicates very well together is important
    - My suggestion (and what is recommanded for the assignment) is to make sure to start early and commit often.
    - For code interference, is to use pull request. if you dont know, in your fork after you do your commits you have to go back to git hub to create a new pull request.
        - After git hub checks your code for merge conflicts, you can merge it to your upstream which is you main repo
        - Dont merge straight away , but instead let the others read your code and check it against theirs.This can prevents conflicts
        ( Both within the team and in the code ) 
    - Time - ngl , the timing of all the projects and their deadlines are all concentrated in one week. so it will be very stressful 

As i am writing this , i jus pulled an all nighter for DENG soooooooooo case in point. 

### DENG

Now to deng in the first sem there is two major thing to look out for:
1. The MST 
2. The Assignment

The MST is on topic A , B and C (Part 1 , 2 and 3 )

+ go into deng file for notes on them (both assignment and mst)
