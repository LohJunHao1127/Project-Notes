# General Adivice for those taking Ades and DENG
## And mb some other stuff:
In the first few weeks the workload is pretty low and most of the assignments are getting rolled out. 

### CPF
1. CA1 
   - In a few weeks you are going to have to write up a resume for CFP. Since you are prob likely to go for a coding related job, I highly suggest that you make a website portfolio( For either the interview or the resume) which was what my teacher suggested. 
   - A website portofolio is basically a website that you make to showcase your projects and your skills on a Website. for e.g, you can check out my ades teacher's website portfolio [here](https://jeremiah-ang.github.io) (Not sponsored).

2. CA2
   - The CPF interview is gonna basically interview you for the job you stated in your resume. 
   - The interview is gonna be a 1 on 1 interview with the teacher where you would be ask a few key questions.
      - Why should they hire you
      - Where do you see yourself in 5 to 10 years
      - What do you plan to do to achieve that goal
      - A few questions that is more specific to your job
      
3. CA3 
   - CA3 would be a role play where you would be doing a roleplay with the teacher and another student.
   - You would be be told what possible countries that you would be tested on and you would have to do research on that country using this link [here](https://www.hofstede-insights.com/country-comparison-tool). Using the research you would have to do a roleplay with the teacher and another student.
     - In the research you would have to know how that country's culture compares to us 
     - With the main focus on the 4 dimensions of culture
        - Power Distance Index (PDI)
        - Individualism vs. Collectivism (IDV)
        - Masculinity vs. Femininity (MAS)
        - Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI)



### ADES

For ades, few of the most annoying things are:
1. when you are pushing and fetching from github
2. when another persons code interferes with your own - having a team that works and communicates very well together is important
    - My suggestion (and what is recommanded for the assignment) is to make sure to start early and commit often.
    - For code interference, is to use pull request. if you dont know, in your fork after you do your commits you have to go back to git hub to create a new pull request.
        - After git hub checks your code for merge conflicts, you can merge it to your upstream which is you main repo
        - Dont merge straight away , but instead let the others read your code and check it against theirs.This can prevents conflicts
        ( Both within the team and in the code ) 
    - Time - ngl , the timing of all the projects and their deadlines are all concentrated in one week. so it will be very stressful 

As i am writing this , i jus pulled an all nighter for DENG soooooooooo case in point. 

### DENG

Now to deng in the first sem there is two major thing to look out for:
1. The MST 
2. The Assignment

The MST is on topic A , B and C (Part 1 , 2 and 3 )

+ go into deng file for notes on them (both assignment and mst)
