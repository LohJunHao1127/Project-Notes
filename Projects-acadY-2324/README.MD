# General Adivice for those taking Ades and DENG
## And mb some other stuff:
In the first few weeks the workload is pretty low and most of the assignments are getting rolled out. 

### CPF
1. CA1 
   - In a few weeks you are going to have to write up a resume for CFP. Since you are prob likely to go for a coding related job, I highly suggest that you make a website portfolio( For either the interview or the resume) which was what my teacher suggested. 
   - A website portofolio is basically a website that you make to showcase your projects and your skills on a Website. for e.g, you can check out my ades teacher's website portfolio [here](https://jeremiah-ang.github.io) (Not sponsored).
   - But the most important thing to note is that you have to make sure that your resume is good the portfolio is just a bonus. your resume must have a career statement or objective, your education, your skills (If your teacher is Louwena she will ask you to pull more hard skills and soft skills into it) , your Interests and any awards or achievements or work experience-if you have any .

2. CA2
   - The CPF interview is gonna basically interview you for the job you stated in your resume. 
   - The interview is gonna be a 1 on 1 interview with the teacher where you would be ask a few key questions.
      - Why should they hire you
      - Where do you see yourself in 5 to 10 years
      - What do you plan to do to achieve that goal
      - A few questions that is more specific to your job
      
3. CA3 
   - CA3 would be a role play where you would be doing a roleplay with the teacher and another student.
   - You would be be told what possible countries that you would be tested on and you would have to do research on that country using this link [here](https://www.hofstede-insights.com/country-comparison-tool). Using the research you would have to do a roleplay with the teacher and another student.
     - In the research you would have to know how that country's culture compares to us 
     - With the main focus on the 4 dimensions of culture
        - Power Distance Index (PDI)
        - Individualism vs. Collectivism (IDV)
        - Masculinity vs. Femininity (MAS)
        - Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI)
   
   *Ps: There is a good chance that louwena might do the the counties in alternating order meaning that she might test the first person on germany and singapore then the next person malaysia and singapore. At the same time, they wont ask you on the scores of each countries instead they will ask you "my teammate is sick but my teammate from malaysia is not wiling to take over his work and help him , i just dont understand why" then you have to explain using the scores that you know *
   *Pps: she might ask the same questions for the different countries like it will be the same for everyone tested on malaysia and singapore but different for the other group*

   Some of the questions that you might be asked are:
   - there is a grp of teammates from so and so country and they are being very stubborn about not using the new system that your team have all decided to use. Even tho the new system is much better than the old one. i just dont know why they are being so stubborn about not using it.
      - Answer : they might not be willing to do that bc they are afraid of change and they are afraid that they might not be able to adapt to the new system. This is because of the high uncertainty avoidance index of the country. The other reason might be that they have a high masculinity score and they are afraid that they might not be able use the new system as well as the old one and they might achieve less than what they are used to.



### ADES

For ades, few of the most annoying things are:
1. when you are pushing and fetching from github
2. when another persons code interferes with your own - having a team that works and communicates very well together is important
    - My suggestion (and what is recommanded for the assignment) is to make sure to start early and commit often.
    - For code interference, is to use pull request. if you dont know, in your fork after you do your commits you have to go back to git hub to create a new pull request.
        - After git hub checks your code for merge conflicts, you can merge it to your upstream which is you main repo
        - Dont merge straight away , but instead let the others read your code and check it against theirs.This can prevents conflicts
        ( Both within the team and in the code ) 
    - Time - ngl , the timing of all the projects and their deadlines are all concentrated in one week. so it will be very stressful 

As i am writing this , i jus pulled an all nighter for DENG soooooooooo case in point. 

### DENG

Now to deng in the first sem there is two major thing to look out for:
1. The MST 
2. The Assignment

The MST is on topic A , B and C (Part 1 , 2 and 3 )

+ go into deng file for notes on them (both assignment and mst)
